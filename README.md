# SCP Wiki Remove Gay Logo Extension
The "SCP Wiki Remove Gay Logo" Chromium extension allows for the customization of logos, titles, and subtitles on the SCP Wiki. By default, it removes many (hopefully all) occurences of leftist politics from the website's iconography. Reclaim your immersion!

## Other
Thank you for checking out my extension! I've been an SCP fan for many years and wanted to give something back to the readers after seeing the horrific responses from the wiki's admins and moderators. Their responses... very toxic!

Please leave bug reports and feature requests in [Issues](https://github.com/mrbooboostank/scp-fix-extension/issues). I plan to make at least a couple of updates to this extension, so feedback is greatly appreciated
